<p>This web-app is a data visualizer about energy production, CO2 emissions and the effect it has in the natural habitats.
   Use the drop-down menus to create the graph with the stats you want to visualize.Keep in mind:
</p>

<p><b>Line Charts:</b> The total number of lines in the chart must not exceed 12, because then the graph will be unreadable.</p>

<p><b>Bar Charts:</b> The total number of bars in the chart must not exceed 4, beacause then the graph will be messy.</p>

<p><b>Scatter Plot (for a given country):</b> You pick exactly one country and 2 indicators. Aggregation is available.</p>

<p><b>Scatter Plot (for a given year):</b> You pick just start year and 2 indicators. Aggregation is <u><b>NOT</b></u> available.</p>
